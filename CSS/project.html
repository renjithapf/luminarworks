                    <h1 class="b4" >Worldwide, experts estimate that people consume around 2.25 billion cups of coffee per day. Researchers have looked at the benefits of drinking coffee for conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. There is evidence to support some, but not all, of these claims.

                        Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts suggest that these and other ingredients in coffee can benefit the human body in various ways.
                        
                        This article looks at the possible health benefits of drinking coffee, the evidence supporting those benefits, and the risks of drinking coffee.</h1>

                        <p style="font-size:17px">Dark roast coffee decreases breakage in DNA strands, which occur naturally but can lead to cancer or tumors if not repaired by your cells.</p>

But the caffeine in two cups of coffee may provide significant protection against developing the condition. In fact, researchers found that women age 65 and older who drank two to three cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop dementia in general.</p>

In fact, scientists believe arabica was the first type of coffee bean ever used. Originating in Ethiopia, arabica beans make up approximately 60% of coffee consumption today. Some coffee brands even mix arabica coffee with its competitor, the robust bean, to balance out robusta's flavor.</p>

As one of the first coffee plants, Bourbon is ideal for crossbreeding to create new arabica varieties.
                        Coffee from the Bourbon plant has a chocolatey and sweet flavor. It also sometimes has a fruity taste, depending on the soil where it's grown.</p>

                    </li style="font-size:17px" ><p style="font-size:17px">Catuai Beans are an arabica coffee variety developed by Brazilians in the 1950s. Its naturally dwarf statue makes it easy to pick its berries, and it has a decent yield potential after the plant reaches three years of age.</p>
                    <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>Excelsa Beans</strong></li><p style="font-size:17px">Arabica and robusta coffee bean varieties may be the most popular coffee beans on the market, but Excelsa beans enjoy the label of being the top four most favored coffee bean variety (Liberica beans being the other).</p>
