            <h4 class="a4">Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. 

                The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. 
                
                Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.
                
                As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe. Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula.  By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.

Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many public coffee houses — called qahveh khaneh — which began to appear in cities across the Near East. The popularity of the coffee houses was unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity. 

Not only did the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but they also listened to music, watched performers, played chess and kept current on the news.  Coffee houses quickly became such an important center for the exchange of information that they were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise.”

With thousands of pilgrims visiting the holy city of Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby” began to spread. </h4>

                <h1 class="d3">In the United States, Nestlé used the Nescafé name on its products until the late 1960s. Later, Nestlé introduced a new brand in Canada and the US called Taster's Choice, which supplanted Nescafé for many[vague] years. The company continues to sell Taster's Choice as a separate product, branded as superior to Nescafé and higher priced.[citation needed]

                    In the United Kingdom, a television advertisement campaign, the Gold Blend couple starring Anthony Head and Sharon Maughan ran in 12 instalments between 1987 and 1993.[5] The first 11 episodes were released as a promotional compilation video called Love Over Gold in 1993. A novelisation of the same name written by Susan Moody (under the pseudonym Susannah James) was released in the same year.[6] The legendary boxer Chris Eubank and soccer star Ian Wright featured separately in television ads in the late 1990s and 2000s.

                    <h1 class="d6">Costa Coffee was founded in London in 1971 by brothers Bruno and Sergio Costa as a wholesale operation supplying roasted coffee to caterers and specialist Italian coffee shops.

In fact, scientists believe arabica was the first type of coffee bean ever used. Originating in Ethiopia, arabica beans make up approximately 60% of coffee consumption today. Some coffee brands even mix arabica coffee with its competitor, the robust bean, to balance out robusta's flavor.</p>
                    
                        <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>Bourbon Beans</strong></li><p style="font-size:17px">Bourbon is a variety of the arabica plant that, despite its name, doesn't taste like the alcoholic beverage. As one of the first coffee plants, Bourbon is ideal for crossbreeding to create new arabica varieties.
                            Coffee from the Bourbon plant has a chocolatey and sweet flavor. It also sometimes has a fruity taste, depending on the soil where it's grown.</p>

Its naturally dwarf statue makes it easy to pick its berries, and it has a decent yield potential after the plant reaches three years of age.</p>
